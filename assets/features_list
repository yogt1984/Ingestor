LOB features:
midprice		: average of the  best bid and ask prices.
spread			: difference btwn best bid and ask prices.
imbalance		: measure of asymetry of buyers or sellers are domiating the order book on a given time.
pwimbalance		: order flow imbalance weighted on the price.
slope			: measure of the liquidity concentration on the order book, if large wider spreads, if small market is liquid thighen spreads.
depth_N			: measure of the total available liquidity at top N level.

trade based features:
vwap			: average price at which the security has traded weigted by volume.
trade_intensity		: number of trades in unit time, measures the speed of trading activity. Higher trade intensity more liquidity and volatility.
trade_volume_imbalance  : detects buyer/seller dominance, positive value indicates agressive buying.
price_impact	        : measures how much price moves per unit of trade volume, higher value indicates more liquidity demand and larger price movements.

vwap_deviation		: detects mispricing relative to volume-weighted price, used to place better market making orders.
intertrade_duration	: measures the time between consecutive trades, shorter duration more agressive trading.

spectral features:
volatility              : measures short term varience
hurst_exponent		: measures mean reversion vs trend following behaviour

psd			: power spectral density

entropy features:        
spectral_entropy	: measures randomnes   in price fluctuations
shannon_entropy		: measures uncertainty in price movements
